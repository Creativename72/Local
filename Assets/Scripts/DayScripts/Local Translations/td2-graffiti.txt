[[Did you graffiti your own trailer?
Tyler: *He grins, hands on his hips.* Mmhm. Thought a splash o’ color could liven up the place. Really ties it together, don’t ya think?
Tyler: Back in the city, I used to think graffiti artists were the coolest. You’d see their work on buildings, train cars... whole alleyways turned into galleries.
Tyler: So, naturally, I thought, "Hey, I could do that."
[[How’d that go?
Tyler: Yeah, not great. Turns out most artists get permission from the city to paint that stuff.
Tyler: Me? I just slapped some paint on the side of an apartment block. Thought I was bein’ some kinda rebel, stickin’ it to the man.
Tyler: Then I got slapped with a \$500 fine. Stuck it to my wallet instead. Lesson learned, I guess. 
Tyler: I still think it’s cool. Wish I could do it somewhere people’d actually see it.
Tyler: It’s one of those things that makes me feel like I’m... addin’ somethin’, y’know? Like leavin’ my mark.
