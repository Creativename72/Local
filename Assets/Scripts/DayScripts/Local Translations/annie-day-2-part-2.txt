//BACK TO NORMAL CONVERSATION STYLE
-StartPart2
Annie: *She exhales softly, leaning back in her seat.* You know, it’s funny. Looking at all this stuff... it reminds me of how much I used to do.
Annie: Back in the city, my life was just… packed. Not just work—cool stuff. Cool people.
Annie: Like, my weekends were drag racing or exploring a new art exhibit. Weeknights? Probably hanging out with friends or trying some random class just because it sounded fun.
Annie: I was never sitting still. And now... here I am, keeping busy in a whole different way.
[[You’re still doing a lot. Maybe too much? | TakeTime $AnnieSelf$(( You think Annie needs to find time for herself. //FLAG: NONE, BUT IF FLAG: AnnieSelf, MESSAGE: You think Annie needs to find time for herself.
[[You’ve always liked keeping busy, huh? | LikedKeepingBusy

-TakeTime
Annie: Maybe. But what else am I supposed to do out here?
Annie: Sitting around feels... wrong, you know? Like, if I’m not doing something, I’m wasting time.
|ScaredOfQuiet


-LikedKeepingBusy
Annie: Always. Even before I moved here, I couldn’t stand being idle. There’s just... always something to do, right?
Annie: I don’t think it’s in my nature to sit around. If I’m not working or occupied, it feels like I’m... slacking.

-ScaredOfQuiet
Annie: It’s not like I’m scared of quiet or anything. I just...
Annie: I need to feel useful. Productive. Like I’m contributing something, you know?
Annie: If I’m not, what’s the point? It’s like... the wheels stop turning, and I don’t know how to deal with that.
Narrator:*She pauses, folding her hands in her lap.*
Annie: I know it’s not healthy, maybe, but staying busy keeps me moving forward. Even if it’s just... running in place.
[[Maybe it’s time to slow down and take a break. || SlowDownScout $AnnieBreak$(( You think Annie needs a break.//FLAG: NONE, BUT IF FLAG: AnnieBreak, MESSAGE: You think Annie needs a break.

-SlowDownScout
Annie: *She hesitates, her brows furrowing.* Slow down, huh? It’s not easy for me, you know.
Annie: But maybe you’re right. Maybe I should... figure out how to stop spinning my wheels so much.

-SlowDownWalter
Annie: *She blinks, looking at Scout with surprise.* Walter said that?
Annie: *She sighs, her expression softening.* Yeah, okay. He’s probably right. He’s always watching out for me, even if I don’t always see it.

-NotProblem
Annie: Yeah, maybe. I mean, this is just how I’ve always been. 
Annie: But... it’s exhausting sometimes. And I wonder if there’s something I’m missing, you know? Something I’m not letting myself see.
|ThanksForSaying

-ThanksForSaying
Annie: *She leans back with a tired smile.* Thanks for saying that, Scout. I don’t know if I’ll ever be great at slowing down, but... I’ll think about it.
Annie: And hey, thanks for keeping me company today. You’re a good one.
Narrator:*Annie stretches, her arms reaching up as she lets out a small yawn.*
Annie: *She chuckles softly.* Whew, I think I might actually take that nap now. You’ve got me all reflective and everything.
[[Glad I could help.
Annie: *She smiles warmly.* Thanks for keeping me company, Scout. It’s nice having someone to talk to, you know?
Annie: Don’t be a stranger, okay? If you’re ever bored, just knock. I’d love to have you over again.
Narrator:*She walks Scout to the door, the soft sound of rain still pattering outside.*
