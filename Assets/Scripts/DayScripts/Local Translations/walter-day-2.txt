//Trail Background
-Start
Narrator:*The skies are overcast, and a soft drizzle paints the valley in shades of gray. The scent of rain-soaked earth fills the air as Scout heads out along the eastern trails toward the watchtower.*
Narrator:*Up ahead, a tall figure appears through the mist. Walter, his sturdy frame unmistakable, trudges steadily down the trail, a faint sound of boots crunching on damp gravel.*
>showCharacters
Walter: Oh, Scout. Didn’t expect to see you out here in this weather.
Walter: *He shifts his weight slightly.* I was just heading to the lake. Thought I’d, uh, check up on you.
[[Check up on me?
Walter: Yeah. Just making sure you’re settling in alright. With the move and everything.
[[Thanks, Walter. I appreciate that.
Narrator:*For a brief moment, a small smile flickers across Walter’s face before he looks up at the sky.*
Walter:*He nods.* Doesn’t look like this rain’s going to let up anytime soon.
Walter: Since we’re close to my tower, why don’t we head up there? No sense getting soaked out here.
[[Sounds good.
[[Yeah, let’s get outta here!
Narrator:*Walter turns without another word, setting off back up the trail. Scout follows, their footsteps blending with the gentle rhythm of the rain. Walter glances over his shoulder occasionally, his steady pace slowing just enough to ensure Scout keeps up.*
>ChangeBackground
//Watchtower Outside Background
Narrator:*The rain grows lighter as they reach the base of the watchtower, the structure rising tall against the misty horizon. Walter stops at the bottom of the stairs, turning to face Scout.*
Walter: Ready to climb?
[[Are guests allowed in the tower? |GuestsAllowed
[[Do you climb these steps every day? |ClimbEveryDay

-GuestsAllowed
Walter: Of course. It’s not just a watchtower—it’s my home. Guests are always welcome.

Walter: Every day. Sometimes more than once.
Walter: *He taps his chest lightly.* Good for the heart, or so they say.
|StartClimbing

-StartClimbing
Narrator:*The wooden stairs creak softly beneath their weight as they climb. The sound of the rain fades, replaced by the occasional whisper of wind winding through the structure.*
Narrator:*At the top, the tower’s balcony offers a view of the valley shrouded in mist. Walter steps ahead, unlocking the door with a practiced motion. He pushes it open and gestures for Scout to enter.*
>ChangeBackground //Walter Interior Background
Walter: Welcome. Make yourself at home.
Narrator:*Scout is greeted by a cramped but cozy interior. Windows line all sides of the room, letting in the soft light of the rainy day.*
Narrator:*In one corner of the room sits a simple bed, its plaid blanket neatly folded at the foot. Another corner features a small kitchenette, the open cupboard stocked with a modest collection of cooking tools and supplies.*
Narrator:*Near the entrance, an electronic keyboard rests against the wall beside a fishing rack displaying an assortment of rods and lures.*

Walter: *He shrugs.* Barely. I dabble here and there. Not very well.

-SmallKitchen
Walter: *He glances at the kitchenette, his tone even.* Gets the job done. I’m not exactly cooking five-course meals here.
Walter: HQ sends a food drop every month or so. I could get fresher stuff from the city, but it’s not worth the hassle. 
Walter: I stick to the basics—sandwiches, soups, stews. Nothing too complicated.
Walter: At my old job, I made huge batches of stuff like this.
[[Where did you used to work?
Walter: *He leans back slightly, his voice steady.* I used to work in an elementary school kitchen. Back in the city.
Walter: I’d get there before sunrise, chop vegetables, set things out... peaceful work. Until the kids showed up.
Walter: *He shakes his head.* You’d think they’d never eaten before with how they’d tear through the place.
Walter: It was noisy, chaotic. Half the time, they didn’t even want what I made. I quit the day I found spaghetti in the cash register.
Walter: *His tone softens.* This job? It’s quiet. Nobody throws soup at me. That’s a win in my book.
[[Bernice told me you cooked with her. (( Bernice told you Walter occasionally visits her to cook meals together. //FLAG: NONE, MESSAGE: Bernice told you Walter occasionally visits her to cook meals together.
Walter: That’s true. I used to bring fish down to her cottage sometimes. She’d always have fresh vegetables waiting. No clue where she got them. 
Walter: *He chuckles faintly.* She didn’t go to the city often, so unless she had a secret garden stashed somewhere, I never figured it out. //SET FLAG TylerVeggiesToBernice
Walter: She always knew how to make things work out here. Had a knack for it. Maybe it comes with age.

Walter: *For a moment, there’s a flicker of something close to excitement in his tone.* Yeah, you could say that. It’s one of my favorite things to do out here.
Walter: *He gestures toward the rack.* Each rod has its own story. That one over there? Caught a pike so big I thought it was gonna pull me in.
Walter: And that one? Snapped clean in half trying to reel in something bigger. Never did find out what it was.
Walter: *He turns toward the window, the faintest hint of a smile on his face.* The valley’s good for it. Lakes, rivers, all kinds of fish. It’s peaceful, but it keeps you sharp.
Walter: You learn patience out there. And sometimes... you just learn to appreciate the quiet.

Walter: *His voice softens.* He’d throw them on the grill, and we’d sit out by his trailer, eating and talking about... whatever came to mind. I enjoyed those moments with him.
Walter: *His gaze drifts to the window.* Haven’t done that in a long time, though. Things changed, I guess.

Narrator: *Walter pauses, his gaze drifting around the interior space. He takes a moment to absorb his surroundings, listening to the soft patter of the rain against the windows. He stares out the window as he speaks.*
Walter: You know, I don’t often get the opportunity to talk to people in person. Or at all, really, in a casual way.
Walter: My job, my position—it’s isolating. I spend most of my days alone up here, with only the occasional radio check-in for company.

Narrator: *Walter’s expression hardens slightly, and he looks down at the floor.*
Walter: So, Annie gave you her take, huh?
Walter: Look, I get it. Annie’s heart was in the right place, but driving a truck into a water silo? That’s not something you just... do.
Walter: *He exhales sharply, running a hand through his fur.* Annie’s legally blind, Scout. She’s not even allowed to operate a vehicle anymore, and for good reason. 
Walter: *His voice softens slightly, but there’s still a hint of frustration.* I get it. She wanted to help. But sometimes trying to fix things without thinking makes everything worse.

Walter: Oh, so Tyler passed the buck to me, huh? Typical.
Walter: *He sighs heavily, running a hand through his fur.* You probably noticed how he brushes things off like they’re no big deal. But let me tell you, Scout. It was a big deal.
Narrator:*He pauses for a moment, before turning to Scout.*
Walter: Tyler was setting up a water pump by the river. I was supervising. Annie was keeping us company.
Walter: *He runs a hand through his fur.* I got a dispatch call on the walkie. Had to head back to the tower. I told Tyler to wait before starting the pump and asked Annie to... keep an eye on him. 
Walter: That was dumb of me. But I figured it would be fine.
Narrator:*He pauses, his tone sharpening.*
Walter: Of course, Tyler didn’t listen. I heard the explosion halfway across the valley. Smoke was already rising by the time I got back.
Walter: *He clenches his jaw.* And Annie? She thought driving Tyler’s truck into the water silo would stop the fire. She meant well, but it was reckless. Too reckless.
Narrator:*Walter grips the edge of the window frame, staring out at the rain-soaked valley.*
Walter: I tore into them both. Tyler, for being a reckless idiot. Annie, for thinking she could handle something so dangerous. I was furious.
Walter: *His voice drops.* It’s my job to keep this valley—and the people in it—safe. And that day, I felt like I’d failed all of us.
