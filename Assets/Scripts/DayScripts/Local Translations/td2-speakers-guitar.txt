Tyler: *He picks up the guitar, inspecting it.* Yeah, this guy.
Tyler: Just picked it up from the city. Speakers must be busted, though. Pretty lame.
Tyler: *He sighs, slinging the strap over his shoulder.* Y’know, I thought this was gonna be my next big thing. Like, my ticket to rockstar fame or whatever.
Tyler: Imagined myself back in the city, shreddin’ at packed venues. The lights, the crowd, the glory!
Tyler: *He pauses, wincing slightly.* Turns out, playin’ guitar is hard. Hurts my fingers, too. And it’s, like... way more work than I thought.
Narrator:*Tyler steps toward the junk pile and hesitates, gripping the guitar tightly.*
Tyler: *Groaning.* Ugh, it was expensive, though. I can’t just toss it, right?
Tyler: Guess I should stick it inside or somethin’. Don’t want the rain ruining it.
Narrator:*He carefully takes the guitar and speakers back into the trailer. Moments later, he re-emerges, dusting his hands off.*
Tyler: Alright. What’s next on the chopping block?
