[[What about that license plate?
Annie: Oh that? *She grins.* That’s from my drag racing days, believe it or not.
[[You raced cars?
Annie: Oh yeah, hard to picture now, huh? Back in the day, I lived for the thrill of the track.
Annie: The roar of the engine, the surge of adrenaline... just you, the car, and the road. No distractions.
Annie: *Her grin softens slightly.* I had to stop when my vision started going. It sucked, but hey, safety first, right?
Annie: Buuuut... if it were legal to drive blind, I’d probably still do it.
Annie: *She chuckles.* Kidding! Mostly. I think giving it up was for the best. You can’t live your whole life glued to the track. Sometimes you gotta pivot.
[[Do you miss racing?
Annie: Sometimes, yeah. But it’s been years now.
Annie: *She shrugs lightly.* Life’s all about adapting, you know? You lose one thing, you find something else.
Annie: These days, I’m just rolling with the punches. Literally, sometimes. Tripping over furniture’s kinda like an extreme sport of its own.
Narrator:*She chuckles softly, the grin lingering as she leans back.*
