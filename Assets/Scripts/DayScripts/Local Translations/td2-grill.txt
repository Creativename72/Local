[[Nice grill. Do you still use it?
Tyler: *He glances at the grill, then shrugs.* Nah, haven’t fired it up in a while.
Tyler: Used to love grillin’ fish, but I’m not much of a fish guy anymore.
Tyler: Tried veggies, but man, it just ain’t the same.

-WhereGetFish
Tyler: Psh. Walter.
Tyler: *His expression hardens slightly.* Look, Walter’s good at what he does ‘n all, but I don’t need his help. I can figure stuff out on my own.

-WhatEating
Tyler: Simple stuff.  Canned, frozen foods, whatever I can get at the general store a few miles up the road.
Tyler: And the veggies I’m growin’, if I’m feeling like it.

Narrator:*Tyler drags the grill over to a spot near his garden, patting it lightly before stepping away.*
Tyler: Mmhm. Ain’t no point keepin’ him around if I’m not usin’ him.
Narrator:*Tyler starts dragging the grill toward the toss pile, giving it one last look before pushing it aside with a small sigh.*
