Narrator:*The weather is clear and crisp, the morning sun breaking through the mist that lingers in the valley. Scout makes their way along the winding trail to Walter’s watchtower. The scent of pine mixes with the smell of damp soil from last night’s rain.*
Narrator:*As Scout climbs the tower and reaches the balcony, they pause to take in the view of the valley below.*
Narrator:*Through the windows of the tower, Scout spots Walter seated at his desk. His broad shoulders are hunched slightly as he sketches on a notepad.*
[[*Knock on the door.* | KnockOnDoor

-KnockOnDoor
Narrator:*Scout steps up to the wooden door and knocks firmly. Walter glances up from his sketchpad. He straightens his posture and gets up to answer the door.*
Walter: Scout, good to see you. Come on in.
|ScoutEnters

-YellForAttention
Narrator:*Scout calls out, their voice cutting through the crisp air. Inside, Walter’s head jerks up in surprise. He swivels his chair around, looking toward the door with a slightly annoyed expression.*
Walter: *He stands to open the door, scratching the back of his neck.* Gosh, Scout, no need to yell. You startled me.

-RunToBalcony
Narrator:*Scout steps to the side of the balcony and waves at Walter through the window. Walter glances up, his furrowed brows softening into a faint smile. He shakes his head and rises from his chair.*
Walter: Forget where the front door is?

Narrator:*Scout enters Walter’s living space. The air is much warmer than the coolness of the valley outside. Scout takes a moment to collect their bearings.*
Walter: So, what brings you back here this time?
[[I’m organizing a dinner get-together and wanted to invite you.
[[Bernice suggested I host a dinner for everyone. Thought I’d invite you. (( The dinner is Bernice’s idea.
Narrator:*Walter crosses his arms, his gaze flickering to the window before meeting Scout’s.*
Walter: With everyone, huh? So, with Annie and Tyler.
Walter: I don’t know, Scout. It’s been a long time since the three of us were in the same room. It’s going to be... awkward. I’m not sure we’re ready for something like this.

Walter: I... don’t know if it’s that simple, Scout. There’s a lot I’ve been holding onto, and letting it go doesn’t come easy.
Narrator:*Walter exhales deeply, crossing his arms.*
Walter: But... you’re right. I owe it to myself—and to them—to try. 
Walter: Maybe it’s time, but I’m not sure if I’m ready.

Walter: I hear you, but I don’t know if I can face him yet. I’ll need to think it over.

Narrator:*He exhales deeply and rolls his shoulders back, shaking off the tension.*
Walter: Alright. Enough heavy talk. Let’s focus on the dinner. You said this was a meal, right? What are we bringing to the table?
[[Fish chowder. Bernice’s recipe!
Walter: Fish chowder, huh? That takes me back to when I still worked in the city.
Walter: I’d go in before sunrise, while the streets were still dark and quiet. I’d be alone in the kitchen, chopping vegetables, deboning fish...
Walter: *His voice softens.* I loved those mornings. Just me and the rhythm of the work. The quiet was comforting. Like the city hadn’t woken up yet.
Narrator:*He snaps out of his thoughts, turning his focus back to Scout.*
Walter: Anyway, fish chowder. We’re gonna need the main ingredient. What were you thinking for the fish?
[[Not sure. Was planning on asking you.
Walter: *He smiles.* Well, I’ve always had a fondness for trout. The sweet undertone, with a hint of nuttiness...
Walter: The lake just up the trail’s full of them. They’re easy to spot with their gold scales and red stripes.
[[Sounds good! Let’s head out. || SoundsGoodLetsHeadOut

Narrator:*Walter and Scout move along the trail leading to the mountain-top lake, their footsteps crunching softly against the damp earth. Walter glances around as they walk.*
Walter: This trail used to be a lot busier. Families, hikers, campers… It’s been quieter these past few years.
>pause2
Walter: Sometimes I miss it. Seeing people out here, enjoying the scenery, and each other’s company.
>pause2
Walter: Places like this, they bring people together. Always thought the outdoors were one of the best ways to connect with each other.
Walter: Maybe times are changing. People have found new spaces to find others.

Walter: *He glances at Scout, his expression softening.* You’re doing something good here, Scout. Bringing everyone together, reminding us of what we’ve got in this valley. I think a lot of us lost sight of that. So… thank you.

Walter: *He stops walking, pointing ahead.* The lake’s just up here. Come on.

Narrator:*The trail opens up to reveal a serene mountain lake, its surface reflecting the trees and sky above. Walter sets his gear down and pulls out two rods, handing one to Scout.*
Walter: Here. Water’s nice and calm today—perfect for fishing. Go ahead and cast your line.
>FishingCast
Walter: And now, we wait.
>pause2
Walter: You know, fishing’s a lot like making friends. You need patience, a bit of luck, and a willingness to keep trying, even when nothing seems to be biting.
>pause2
Walter: You could sit here for hours without a single nibble. And then, just when you’re about to pack it in, you feel that tug on the line.
>pause2
Walter: You’ve gotta check your bait, keep casting, and let the fish come to you. Same as letting people open up in their own time. It takes patience and effort.
>pause2
Walter: Your dinner idea was nice. Create a space where everyone feels comfortable. It’s kinda like finding the right spot to fish.
Walter: Like here. Calm waters, good shade, nice temperature. 
Walter: We can just sit and wait for the fish to join us on their own time.
>pause2
Walter: Hmm. Nothing biting yet?
Walter: Let’s keep at it. Persistence pays off.
>FishingBite
Narrator:*Walter holds up the line with his paw.*
Walter: Nice work, Scout!
Narrator:*Walter examines the trout, nodding appreciatively.*
Walter: That’s a good-sized trout. This’ll make a fine addition to Bernice’s chowder.
Narrator:*Walter’s expression softens as he turns to Scout.*
Walter: Hmm... Listen, Scout, you’ve got other ingredients to gather, don’t you? You should head back down. I think I’ll stay here for a bit. It’s a perfect day for fishing, and I could use the quiet.
[[Alright. Thanks for spending the afternoon with me, Walter.
[[And for helping me get the fish.
Walter: *He gives a small nod.* I’ll see you tonight, then.
Narrator:*Walter watches Scout pack up their gear before turning back to the lake. He casts his line once more, the fishing rod a steady silhouette against the calm waters.*

Narrator:*Scout starts down the trail, the fresh trout in their pack. Behind them, the sun casts its warm, golden glow on the valley.*
