Narrator:*Sometime after sunset, Scout once again finds themself in front of their journal, pen in hand. The room is quiet as they begin to reflect on the day's events.*
Journal: Today I visited Tyler, Walter, and Annie, and learned more about their story. It feels like...
[...there’s bad blood between them.
[...they need someone to help bridge the gaps between them.
[...they all care about each other, even if they don’t show it.

Journal: Walter gave his version of events today.
Journal: It feels like there are a lot of feelings he's been holding onto.
Journal: Walter seems to place most of the blame for what happened on...

Narrator:*As Scout is about to write another line into the journal, their phone buzzes against the desk. They glance at the screen. It’s from Bernice.*

Narrator:*Scout picks the phone up and answers.*
[[Hello?
Bernice: Scout, dear! Hope I didn’t catch you at a bad time. How are you doing?
[[I’m doing well, still settling in.
[[It’s been great so far!
[[Holding up just fine!
Bernice: Glad to hear it.
Bernice: Now tell me, how are the others? Walter... has he been keeping to himself?
[[Walter’s a bit lonely. He misses the sense of community that used to be here. | ABitLonely
[[He’s still committed to his role as the protector of the Valley. | CommittedToRole
[[He seems stuck in the past. Still hasn’t moved on from what happened with the others. | StuckInThePast

-ABitLonely
Bernice: I thought as much.
Bernice: The three of them were such good friends, before things fell apart for them.
| HowsAnnie

-CommittedToRole
Bernice: That sounds like him. Always watching, always carrying responsibility on his shoulders.
| HowsAnnie

-StuckInThePast
Bernice: Ah... I was worried about that. Old wounds take time to heal, but time alone won’t do it.
| HowsAnnie

-HowsAnnie
Bernice: And Annie? Still keeping herself busy?
[[Yeah. She had to call off our hangout today, she was so tired. | SheWasSoTired
[[She really needs a break from her work. | ReallyNeedsBreak
[[She still misses the times she spent with Walter and Tyler. | MissesTime

-SheWasSoTired
Bernice: That girl always did have a hard time knowing when to stop.
|HowsTyler

-ReallyNeedsBreak
Bernice: I was afraid of that. She doesn’t realize she’s running herself ragged.
> SetFlag{AnnieBreakForReal, true}
| HowsTyler

-MissesTime
Bernice: Of course she does. I think they all do, in a way.
|HowsTyler

-HowsTyler
Bernice: And how's Tyler? Has he opened up?
[[It’s hard to get through to him, to see what he’s really like. | HardToGet
[[He showed me his garden, which is a good first step. | ShowedGarden
[[It seems like he’s still trying to put on the cool guy act. | CoolGuy

-HardToGet
Bernice: That boy’s always putting up walls. But I think he wants someone to break through them.
|BerniceSigh

-ShowedGarden
Bernice: Oh? Now that’s something. 
Bernice: He used to bring me fresh veggies when I was making soup, you know.
Bernice: Maybe he just wanted a good homemade meal... or maybe he really cares about this community.
|BerniceSigh

-CoolGuy
Bernice: Yes, that sounds like him. All bravado, but deep down, he cares.
|BerniceSigh

-BerniceSigh
Narrator:*Scout hears Bernice let out a soft sigh.*
Bernice: Oh Scout... It doesn’t sound like any of them are doing particularly well.
Bernice: The valley isn’t what it used to be. They’ve all grown so distant from one another. And that’s a shame.
Bernice: Community is important. It’s what keeps people from getting lost in themselves.
Narrator:*She pauses, then her tone shifts to something more hopeful.*
Bernice: I have an idea. A way to get everyone in the same room again.
Bernice: You should host a dinner. Something simple, something warm. A shared meal.
[[Good idea! | TheWayISee
[[I dunno... I don’t have a lot of ingredients to work with here... | OhDontWorry
 
-OhDontWorry
Bernice: Oh, don’t worry about that. We can work that out. 
| TheWayISee

-TheWayISee
Bernice: The way I see it, half the battle is just giving them a reason to be in the same place.
Bernice: But there is one thing you need to promise me.
Benice: Don’t tell them this was my idea.
[[Why not?
[[Alright, I won’t.
Bernice: I want them to come because they *want* to, not because they feel obligated to me.
Bernice: If they think they’re doing it as a favor to an old woman, it won’t mean as much. This has to be their choice.
Narrator:*Scout shifts in their seat, considering the idea. Before they can respond, Bernice continues.*
Bernice: Now, let’s talk food. I was thinking of something simple but hearty.
Bernice: And, this would be the perfect opportunity to put that old crock pot of mine to use.
Bernice: It’s a fine thing. Served me well for years, and I bet it’ll do the same for you.
Bernice: Now, what kind of cook are you, Scout?

[[I can hold my own. | HoldMyOwn
[[I’m... alright? Average? | Average
[[I am bad. Objectively bad. | ObjectivelyBad

-HoldMyOwn
Bernice: Good. An important life skill to have, Scout.
| FlippingThrough

-Average
Bernice: That’s alright. We can find something on the simpler side to make.
| FlippingThrough

-ObjectivelyBad
Bernice: *She chuckles.* Oh, well, at least you’re being honest!
Bernice: I’ll find something simple, no complicated steps...
| FlippingThrough

-FlippingThrough
Narrator:*Scout hears Bernice flipping through some pages on the other end of the line, muttering to herself.*
Bernice: Hmm... Nope, too complicated, too sweet... too many ingredients, too many steps... Aha!
Bernice: How about a fish chowder? Perfect for a gathering to warm yourself up on a cold night.
[[Sounds good!
Bernice: Now, let’s see... What ingredients do you have on hand right now?
[[I have milk and cream.
[[I only have milk and cream.
Bernice: *Bernice lets out an amused sigh.* Not even salt, Scout?
Bernice: Alright, so you’ll need a few things. Listen closely.
Bernice: You’ll need cream and milk for the base. Then, some fish, of course. Something fresh is best.
Bernice: You’ll need veggies—carrots, onions, and potatoes. And finally, some seasonings. Salt, pepper, onion powder and paprika should do it.
Bernice: It’s not too complicated, but you’ll need to ask around for some of it.
[[I’ll talk to the others tomorrow and see if they can help. | ItllFeelNatural
[[You want me to go around asking for free food? | AskingFreeFood

-AskingFreeFood
Bernice: Oh, don’t think about it like that! You’re all just pitching in to make something delicious together.
| ItllFeelNatural

-ItllFeelNatural
Bernice: It’ll feel more natural this way. You have a reason to stop by, a small favor to ask. Makes the invitation feel more casual.
Bernice: Alright, that’s my big scheme. Think you can pull it off?
[[I’ll do my best!
[[We’ll see...
Bernice: Good luck, dear. And let me know how it goes.
Narrator:*The call ends. Scout sets the phone down, staring at the ingredient list in front of them.*
Narrator:*They settle down for the night, ready for their mission to bring the valley together to start the next morning.*
