-Start
Narrator:*Scout walks along the familiar trail toward Tyler’s trailer. The sun shines brightly, and a gentle breeze rustles the leaves overhead.*
Narrator:*As they round the corner, they spot Tyler lying on his back in the grass, arms stretched behind his head, a juice box dangling from his fingers. He doesn’t look over as Scout approaches.*
Narrator:*Scout stops near him, taking in the sight of Tyler sprawled out, completely at ease.*

[[What are you doing? | WhatDoing
[[*Join him without saying anything.* | JoinHim

-WhatDoing

Narrator:*Tyler takes a long, slow sip from his juice box, squinting up at the sky.*
Tyler: Watchin’ clouds. Not much else goin’ on today, so... why not?
[[Mind if I join you? | MindIfIJoin
[[*Join him.* | JoinHim

-MindIfIJoin
Tyler: Knock yourself out, man. Plenty o’ grass to go around.
|SuddenlyShifts

-JoinHim
Narrator:*Scout sits down on the grass beside Tyler, glancing up at the sky. Tyler doesn’t say anything, but a small smirk crosses his face as he sips his juice.*
|SuddenlyShifts

-SuddenlyShifts
Tyler: *He suddenly shifts, turning onto his side.* What’s up, Scout.
Tyler: Was gonna pull some stuff from the garden today, y’know? Check on the veggies and all that.
Tyler: *He chuckles softly, gesturing at the sky.* But, uh, this felt way more important. Juice box, clouds, grass… hard to beat.
[[What’s in your garden?
Narrator:*He pauses, looking vaguely thoughtful as he stares up at the sky.*
Tyler: It’s a lotta stuff. I’ve been using a technique I learned back in the city, helps the plants grow together.
Tyler: I’ll show ya later, if we get the chance.
Narrator:*He pauses, sitting up.*
Tyler: So? What brings you out here today? Or are you just wanting to kick back with me and enjoy this perfect day?
[[I’m hosting a dinner get-together with everyone in the valley.
Narrator:*Tyler lowers the juice box mid-sip, blinking at Scout like they just spoke another language. He shifts to sit up, brushing stray bits of grass off his jacket.*
Tyler: Wait. Everyone? Like, Walter and Annie too?
[[Yeah. Everyone. | Everyone
[[Is that a problem? | IsThatProblem

-Everyone
Narrator:*Tyler exhales sharply through his nose, leaning back on his hands. He avoids Scout’s gaze, staring at the sky instead.*
Tyler: Huh. That’s... big.
Tyler: I mean, I get it, Scout, but... it’s complicated. You know what happened.

-IsThatProblem
Narrator:*Tyler exhales sharply through his nose, leaning back on his hands. He avoids Scout’s gaze, staring at the sky instead.*
Tyler: I dunno. Maybe?
Tyler: I mean... Scout, you know what happened.

Narrator:*His expression hardens, and he sits up straighter.*
Tyler: Bernice isn’t here, Scout. She doesn’t control my life, and no one else does either.
Tyler: *He exhales sharply, rubbing the back of his neck.* Sorry. I didn’t mean to snap. It’s just... I need to figure this out on my own time, okay?
Tyler: *He looks away, his voice softening.* Thanks for tryin’, but don’t push me. I’ll think about it when I’m ready.

$TylerGoodEnding$Tyler: *Tyler turns to face Scout.* I’ll give it some thought, Scout. No promises, but I’ll think about showin’ up.
Tyler: *He exhales and leans back slightly, his gaze shifting toward the garden.* In the meantime, anythin’ I can do for dinner? At least let me do somethin’ useful.
[[We’re making fish chowder with veggies.
[[If I could just get some fresh veggies from your garden...
Tyler: *He raises an eyebrow, nodding thoughtfully.* Hmm, yeah, I can do that. Pretty sure I got somethin’ good growin’ out there.
Tyler: C’mon, lemme show ya.
Narrator:*Tyler gestures for Scout to follow him as he stands, dusting off his pants. He leads the way around the side of the trailer to the garden, his tone softening as he talks.*

Tyler: Welcome back to my little garden. Ain’t much, but it’s good, honest work.
Tyler: So, what do you need for that soup?
[[Carrots, onions, and potatoes.
Tyler: *He nods, scanning the garden rows with a focused look.* Alright. Let’s see...
Tyler: Potatoes are over there with the corn and beans. Carrots and onions? They’re in the plot next to the lettuce.
>StartMinigame //MINIGAME HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tyler: Nice workin’, Scout. This harvest’s lookin’ pretty good.
[[You must put a lot of work into this place, huh.
Tyler: *Tyler smiles at the compliment.* Yep, I sure do. Like I said, I try hard sometimes.
Tyler: Back in the city, I learned a technique called the Three Sisters method. Or somethin’ like that.
[[How come plants are planted together instead of separate?
Tyler: I’ll tell ya. And it ain’t ‘cause I’m sloppy.
Tyler: It’s a technique I picked up back in the city. Pretty neat.
Tyler: Like, each plant helps the others out. Look...
//Focus on left plot. CAMERA
>FocusOnLeftPlot
Tyler: The beans? They fix nitrogen in the soil, makin’ it rich for the corn and potatoes.
Tyler: The corn grows tall, givin’ the beans something to climb on. And the shade it provides keeps the potatoes cool.
Tyler: Then you got the potatoes. They loosen up the soil, lettin’ everyone’s roots grow deeper. Teamwork, y’know?
//Focus on right plot.
>FocusOnRightPlot
Tyler: Over here, carrots keep pests away from the onions. The onions? They scare off aphids. And the lettuce? Keeps the ground moist and weed-free.
Tyler: It’s like a whole garden community. Everyone plays their part.

Tyler: What, so Walter’s the corn, standin’ tall and bossin’ everyone around? Annie’s the beans, climbin’ all over and gettin’ into trouble? And me? I’m the potato, sittin’ in the dirt doin’ nothin’?
Tyler: Actually, that sounds pretty accurate.
