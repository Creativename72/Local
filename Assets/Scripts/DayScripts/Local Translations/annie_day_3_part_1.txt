Narrator:*Scout makes their way up the familiar trail to Annie’s cabin. The air is cool and crisp, with the faint scent of pine lingering in the breeze.*
Narrator:*They step onto the porch and knock on the door. A moment later, Annie opens it, adjusting her glasses with one hand while holding a steaming mug in the other.*
Annie: Hey there, Scout! Back so soon, hmm? Come on in.

Narrator:*She leads them inside the cabin, the scent of an apple-scented candle drifting through the air. She settles onto the couch, patting the seat beside her for Scout to join.*
Annie: Just made some tea and was flipping through my audiobooks. Been on a big mystery kick lately.
Annie: Love a good thriller—though my sister keeps telling me to branch out.
Narrator:*She takes a sip from her mug, tilting her head towards Scout.*
Annie: Anyways! What’s up with you? Anything new happen?
[[I was planning a little get-together dinner party with everyone in the valley. | IPlanning
[[Bernice wanted me to host a dinner and get everyone together. | BerniceWanted

-IPlanning
Annie: *She perks up slightly.* A dinner party, huh? I’m guessing casual.
Annie: *She chuckles.* Can’t imagine Walter *or* Tyler in fancy outfits.
Annie: It’ll be so nice to see everyone again! It’s been so-
| OhShoot

-BerniceWanted
Annie: She really wants to see us all get along again, huh? Guess I should’ve guessed.
Annie: *She thinks for a moment.* It would be nice to see everyone again. It’s been so-
| OhShoot

-OhShoot
Narrator:*She cuts herself off mid-sentence.*
Annie: Oh, shoot! Scout, I just picked up a work shift for tonight.
Annie: I didn’t have any plans this morning, so I thought getting in a few more hours of work would be fine.
Narrator:*She sighs, rubbing the back of her neck.*
Annie: Ugh, figures. Every time I actually want to do something, I’ve already overbooked myself.
Narrator:*Annie shakes her head, giving a small apologetic smile.*
Annie: Sorry, Scout. I’d love to come, really. But it’s just one of those things—I hate sitting around with nothing to do. Felt like I’d be wasting time if I didn’t grab the extra shift.

-HuhIGuess
Annie: Huh... I guess it could be.
Annie: And I guess I have been sitting on my butt not moving for a while now.
Annie: Plus, I really do want to see Walter and Tyler again...
Annie: Yeah, I’d much rather be going to the dinner than work another shift.
Annie: I’ll see if I can find someone to cover my shift. Might be tricky on short notice, but... I’ve got a few favors to cash in.

Annie: *She sighs.* I know, I know. I need a break.
Annie: It’s just tough for me. Being productive is what keeps me motivated. Otherwise, I feel like I’m just sittin’ there.
Annie: I mean... you are right. I do need one...
Annie: Plus, I really do want to see Walter and Tyler again...
Annie: *She pauses for a moment.* Okay, I’ll see if I can find someone to cover my shift. Might be tricky on short notice, but... I’ve got a few favors to cash in.

-HeToldYou
Annie: He told you, did he? He’s been saying that to me even before everything split off.
Annie: I’m sure if we were still talking, he’d say that to me now, too.
Annie: ...I do want to see the others again. Help put Walter at ease, at least. That I’m not running myself completely ragged...

Annie: *She sighs.* Yeah, that’s what I figured.
Annie: Look, I do want to go to the dinner, but I already committed to working tonight’s shift.
Annie: I don’t work the whole night, just ‘til the sun sets. I’ll try and see if I can make it a bit later! I’d still love to see everyone.
|EitherWayIHope

-EitherWayIHope
Annie: *She sighs, shaking her head.* Either way, I hope it goes well. If I can’t make it, you better tell me all about it later.
Annie: So, what’s on the menu? What are you making?

-HelpYou
Annie: Anything I can do to help? Just in case I can’t make it to the dinner, I still wanna pitch in somehow.
[[I need fish, veggies, and spices.
Annie: Oh! Well, Scout, you’ve come to the right place. My pantry’s stocked to the brim with spices.
Annie: My sister and I always grab a ton when we go to the spice market in the city. Problem is... I don’t always know what I’m grabbing.
Annie: *She gestures toward the small pantry in the corner of the kitchen.* So yeah, go nuts. Take what you need!
