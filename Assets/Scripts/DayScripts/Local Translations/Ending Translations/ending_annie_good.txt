//1. DONE

-Start
Narrator:*The sun has dipped below the horizon, casting an amber glow across the valley. Inside Scout’s cozy kitchen, warm light illuminates the counter. The gathered ingredients from Walter, Annie, and Tyler are neatly arranged in front of them.*
Narrator:*Scout rolls up their sleeves, ready to dive into the final preparations.*
//for each of these choices, play the correct sound effect after the choice is selected
//also no character art for cooking
[Chop the vegetables. > PlaySound{chop}
Narrator:*Scout grabs a potato and starts peeling. The peeler slips. After fumbling, they slice uneven chunks of potatoes, carrots, and onions.*
[Heat the pot and add some oil. > PlaySound{heatPot}
Narrator:*Scout places a pot on the stove, clicks the burner a few times, and pours in some oil. They tilt the pot to spread it around.*
[Saute the vegetables. > PlaySound{sauteVeggies}
Narrator:*The vegetables sizzle loudly. Oil pops as they stir, and they slam the lid on.*
[Add the fish and season. > PlaySound{addFish}
Narrator:*Scout tosses the fish into the pot, splashing broth. They shake in spices, pausing to read the labels, then adding more.*
[Finish with cream. > PlaySound{cream}
Narrator:*They pour in the cream and stir, watching the broth turn creamy.* > PlaySound{stir}
[Have a taste. > PlaySound{taste}
Narrator:*Scout tastes the chowder, nodding in relief. The veggies are soft, the fish is flaky, and it smells good.*

Narrator:*Scout wipes their hands on a dish towel and takes a deep breath. The chowder isn’t perfect, but it’s ready.*
Narrator:*A knock at the door interrupts them.*

//2.

Narrator:*Scout wipes their hands quickly on a dish towel and heads to the door. Opening it, they find Walter standing stiffly, his arms crossed and his expression hard to read.*
Walter: Scout. 
Walter: Chowder smells good.
[Come on in, Walter.
Narrator:*Scout steps aside to let him in. Walter enters, standing near the door awkwardly instead of making himself comfortable. His eyes scan the room briefly before settling on the floor.*
Walter: Place looks fine. I remember when I would come here with Bernice.
Walter: It’s different now, isn’t it. Pretty... empty.
Narrator:*He doesn’t move closer to the counter, instead shifting his weight from one foot to the other.*
Walter: Bernice was always nice to be around. Quiet, but not in an awkward way. She was kind. Gave people space but still made ‘em feel seen.
Narrator:*Walter pauses, glancing toward the window before continuing.*
Walter: I hope she’s happy out there in the city. She deserves that, at least. Even if I can’t picture her anywhere but here.
Narrator:*Scout nods, offering a small smile, but Walter doesn’t respond. He stands by the counter, silent again, looking lost in thought. The kitchen fills with the faint sounds of the bubbling chowder.*

//3.

Narrator:*Scout hears the ringing of the doorbell. They open the door to find Annie standing there, holding a wicker basket full of jars. Her face lights up with a warm smile.*
Annie: Hey, Scout. Took me a while—haven’t needed to come to this side of the valley in ages. Had to stop a couple times just to get my bearings.
Annie: Figured I’d bring something fun. These are all the mystery jars I had in my pantry. Can’t read the labels, so I never took the gamble. Thought there might be some tasty treats among the collection.
[Welcome, Annie!
Narrator:*Annie enters the cottage, tilting her head up and sniffing the air.*
Annie: Wow, it smells amazing in here. Is that chowder?
Annie: I can smell all the spices you used! Glad you could make good use of them.
Narrator:*Scout nods, gesturing toward the pot on the stove. Annie sets her basket down near the counter, leaning in slightly to get a better whiff.*
Annie: You’ve outdone yourself, Scout! Can’t wait to try it.
Narrator:*Walter, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed, looks up when Annie enters. His expression is neutral, but there’s a flicker of recognition in his eyes.*
Walter: Annie... It’s been a while. Didn’t think you’d make it.
Narrator:*Annie’s excitement doesn’t waver as she beams at him.*
Annie: Walter! Oh, it’s so good to hear your voice again! I’ve missed you. How’ve you been?
Walter: Same as ever. Keeping busy with the tower.
Narrator:*Annie pauses for a moment, as if expecting more, but presses on with her usual energy.*
Annie: *She laughs lightly.* Busy, huh? Yeah, me too.

Walter: That’s... good. Glad to hear it.
Narrator:*Walter eyes the basket, but doesn’t say anything. Before things can get too awkward, Annie swings her basket around. The sounds of jars clinking can be heard from within.*
Annie: I brought some jars from my pantry. No frickin’ clue what's in them, though. Bought them with my sister a while back, but never had the courage to do a blind taste test.
Walter: *Walter nods.* I see. Well, I spot some pickled veggies... some candied fruit... 
Walter: *He sighs.* Some... cake in a jar? Really? Who thinks of this stuff...
Walter: Annie, some of this stuff is expired.
Annie: What! No way! Dang, I shoulda had someone read me those labels months ago!

Narrator:*Time passes as Scout, Walter, and Annie sit in the dining room, chatting idly. Though Annie does most of the talking, they share stories and updates about life in the valley.*
Narrator:*Eventually, the conversation peters out, replaced by an unspoken realization: Tyler isn’t coming.*
Walter: *Walter leans back in his chair with a sigh.* Well. Looks like we’ve got one no-show.
Walter: Honestly... maybe it’s for the best. Might’ve just stirred things up.
Annie: *Her smile falters slightly.* Dang... I was hoping he’d come. Would’ve been nice to see him again.
[Agreed. Tyler should be here.
[Maybe he just isn’t ready.
[Chowder time.
Narrator:*Walter nods, getting up from the dining table and heading into the kitchen. He opens the pot and serves three bowls of piping-hot chowder.*
Narrator:*He brings the bowls out into the dining room, placing a serving in front of Scout and Annie.*
Annie: Thanks, Walter.
Narrator:*Walter gives a short nod and sits down across from her. Soon, the sounds of clinking spoons fills the space.*
Walter: It’s good. 
Annie: *Annie smiles at Scout.* It’s great. Scout, you’ve really outdone yourself. This is delicious.
Narrator:*Annie takes a sip of her chowder, her expression thoughtful.*
Annie: Y’know, it’s a shame Tyler didn’t come. Doesn’t feel complete, does it? Like, we’re almost there but not quite.
Walter: *Walter sets his spoon down.* Maybe he just... wasn’t ready.
Narrator:*The mood dips slightly, and Walter leans back in his chair, staring at his half-empty bowl.*
Annie: *Annie glances at Walter, trying to get his attention.* Y’know, Walter... I came here hoping we could talk. About everything.
Narrator:*Walter glances at her, but his expression hardens slightly. He doesn’t respond, instead picking at chunks of fish and vegetables in his chowder in silence.*
Annie: *Annie huffs.* I was under the impression you two were trying to reconnect, that we were ready to start hanging out again. 
Walter: *He exhales through his nose.* It’s not that simple, Annie.
Walter: I’m not ready yet.
Walter: Just give me time.
Narrator:*Annie sighs, looking back down at her own serving of chowder.*
[Take all the time you need, Walter.
[You won’t get there if you don’t try.
Narrator:*Walter glances at Scout, his expression softening just a little. He nods faintly, though he doesn’t say anything.]

//7.

Narrator:*The three sit in silence for a few more moments, the weight of the conversation hanging in the air. The sound of spoons scraping against bowls is the only thing filling the room.*
Narrator:*Eventually, Annie sets her empty bowl down and stretches her arms above her head.*
Annie: *She lets out a small sigh.* Well, I should probably get going. My sister and I have a day trip planned tomorrow.
Narrator:*Walter shifts his weight, letting out a long sigh before speaking.*
Walter: Well... I guess I should head back. Long hike to the tower.
Narrator:*Walter straightens up, walking to the door without looking back. Annie follows after a beat.*
Narrator:*The three stand in the doorway for a moment, the weight of everything unsaid left hanging in the air.*
Walter: Take care, Scout.
Annie: Thanks for having us, Scout. Let’s hang out again soon, okay? 
Annie: We can go pester Tyler, If he’ll have us.
Narrator:*Walter lets out one final grumble before stepping out into the night, followed by Annie. The door closes with a soft click, leaving Scout alone in the now-empty house.*
Narrator:*After clearing everything up, they head to the desk and pull out their journal.*

Journal: Tonight didn’t go as planned. I thought we could all come together, but… it seems like we’re still far apart. Walter seems...
[...like he’s holding himself back from everyone.
[...unsure how to bridge the gap with anyone.
[...like he’s given up on reconnecting.
Journal: Annie was...
[...hopeful about reconnecting.
[...trying her best to keep things light.
[...disappointed that things didn’t go further.
Journal: And Tyler...
[...never showed.
[...wasn’t ready to take the step I was hoping for.
[...still feels like he’s avoiding everyone.
Journal: I wanted tonight to bring us closer, but maybe it’s not something that can happen overnight. Maybe it’ll take more time.
Narrator:*Scout closes their journal slowly, the weight of the day sinking in. They glance out the window at the dark valley beyond, letting out a soft sigh.*
Journal: Tomorrow’s another day.
Narrator:*Scout sets the journal aside, the faint sound of crickets filling the room as they sit quietly in thought.*
