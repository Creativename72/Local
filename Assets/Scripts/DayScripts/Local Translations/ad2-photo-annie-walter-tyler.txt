[[This lake photo… Is that you with Walter and Tyler?
Annie: Huh? Oh yeah, that’s us. Wow, I forgot that was still up.
Annie: That was back when we used to hang out all the time. Weekends were usually spent down by the lake.
Annie: Tyler would bring his guitar, Walter would grumble about the noise, and I’d... well, I’d just sit back and enjoy the company.
[[Sounds like good memories.
Annie: *She nods, smiling faintly.* Yeah. It was simple, you know? No screens, no work calls. Just us and the water.
Annie: Bernice took the photo. She always had her camera on her. 
Annie: Walter loves this photo. He must have a copy of it somewhere at his place.

Annie: *She glances at Scout, her smile softening.* Yeah, I guess. Maybe I just don’t know how to bridge that gap anymore.

Annie: *She sighs.* Sometimes. But I’m not sure where I’d even start. We all just... drifted apart after everything.

[[It’s never too late to try.
Annie: Maybe. I guess part of me misses that. Being able to just... exist with them, no expectations or pressure.
Annie: But the past feels so far away now.
