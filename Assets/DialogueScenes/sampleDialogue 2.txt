Walter: This is a test section of dialogue.
Tyler: You can click through each line that's being read.
Tyler: Dont forget to include which characters are in the scene at the top!
Walter: You can pick from multiple options to have branching dialogue.
Walter: What choice would you like to pick?
[choice1]
I would like to pick option 1.
[choice2]
I would like to pick option 2.

Walter:You picked option 1!
Walter:Alongside branching paths, you can also set a dialogue segment to go to another segment by having a goto statement at the end.
GOTO:markdown

id:choice2
Walter:You picked option 2!
Walter:Alongside branching paths, you can also set a dialogue segment to go to another segment by having a goto statement at the end.

Walter:You can also add additional formatting to text using tags like <i>so</i>.
goto:lastSection

id:lastSection
Walter: That pretty much sums it up.
Walter: This system should be able to handle any number of branching paths or dialogue flow or even circular paths for dialogue.



Walter: The program should ignore any blank lines, so feel free to include extra whitespace if it makes for better formatting.
Walter: If you want to end a dialogue section you can just make a line saying goto:end. (this is not case sensitive)
Walter: It should also end the dialogue section if you don't include a goto:end, but i think having it works best for clarity/readability.
goto:end
