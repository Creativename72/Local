Walter: Scout, glad to see you. Come on in.

Walter: Gosh, Scout, you startled me. You know better’n to go yellin’ ‘nless there’s an emergency.
Walter: Come on in.

[organizing]
I’m organizing a get-together dinner with everyone in the valley.

I was gonna cook a big meal and wanted to invite you.

:[Walter pauses, his expression tightening slightly.] 

Walter: And by everyone, you mean Annie and Tyler, too?
Walter: Look, Scout, I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but… things have been a bit rough between us lately. I’m not sure a dinner is going to fix that.


:[What do you want to say?]
[a_start]
It won’t solve everything, but it’ll be a start…
[you_care]
You all mean a lot to each other, even if things are rough…
[move_forward]
I know it’s hard, but you can’t keep holding onto the past…


id:a_start
[a_start2]
Getting everyone together would be a good first step.

id:a_start2
:[Walter sighs and looks out the window for a moment before turning back to Scout.] 
Walter: I suppose you’re right. It won’t solve everything, but it’s a start.
:[He looks away for a moment.] 
Walter: It’s been such a long time since we all sat down with each other and talked.
Walter: Maybe getting everyone together is what we need to break the ice.

[you_care2]
I’ve been around the valley. I know how much each of you care.

id:you_care2
:[Walter’s expression softens as he listens.] 
Walter: You’ve been paying attention, haven’t you? Running all over the valley, talking to everyone here. 
:[He chuckles.]
Walter: I guess we all still care. It’s just hard to remember that sometimes. It’s been so long…
Walter: Alright, you’ve convinced me. Maybe this dinner is what we need to start mending our relationship.
goto:continue


id:move_forward
[move_forward2]
We need to move forward and face the situation head on.

:[Walter looks down, his jaw tightening slightly.] 
Walter: Easier said than done, Scout. But…
:[He sighs, running a hand through his fur.] 
Walter: You’ve got a point. Holding onto the past isn’t doing us any favors.
Walter: Alright. Let’s do this.
goto:continue


id:continue
Walter: Okay, let’s figure this out. You said this was a dinner? What are we bringing to the table?


[chowder]
Some sorta Fish Chowder.

id:chowder
:[Walter’s expression softens a bit.] 
Walter: Fish Chowder, hmm? Always did have a soft spot for that dish.
Walter: That was one of the more popular dishes I used to prep back at the cafeteria I worked at.
:[Walter appears lost in thought.] 
Walter: All those quiet mornings alone in that kitchen, chopping vegetables, deboning fish…
:[He snaps out of it.] 
Walter: Ah, well, what fish were you thinking of including?


[planning_on_you]
Not sure. I was planning on asking you.


id:planning_on_you
:[Walter smiles.] 
Walter: Well, I have always had a fondness for trout. The sweet undertone, with a hint of nuttiness…
Walter: There’s plenty of trout to catch in the lakes just up the trail from here. They’re easy to spot with their gold scales and red stripes. 


[sounds_good]
Sounds good! Let’s head out.

[see_red]
I can’t see red!


id:sounds_good
goto:trail


id:see_red
:[Walter chuckles.] 
Walter: No need to worry. I still got a good set of eyes. Plus, they’re pretty distinctive even without the stripes.
Walter: Shall we head off?
goto:trail

:[Walter and Scout move their way up the trail to the mountain-top lake. As the hike goes on, Walter begins to speak.]

Walter: This trail used to be a lot busier.
Walter: Families, hikers, campers... It's been quieter these past few years.

Walter: Sometimes I miss it. People out in nature, enjoying the scenery, and each other’s company.

Walter: Always thought places like this were one of the best places for people to connect with each other…

Walter: You’re doing a good thing, Scout. Bringing everyone together, reminding us what we’ve got here. I think we all lost sight of that.
Walter: So, thank you.

Walter: Ah, uh, the lake should be just up here...
Walter: Here, take this rod, and let’s see what we can fish up.

Walter: You know, fishing is a lot like making friends. You need patience, a bit of luck, a willingness to keep trying, even when things don’t seem to be biting.
pause(3)
Walter: Sometimes, you spend hours out here without a single nibble, and just when you’re about to give up, something tugs on your line.
pause(3)
Walter: You need to keep checking your bait and casting your line. You have to let the fish come to you just like letting someone open up to you when they're ready. It takes time.
pause(3)
Walter: Your dinner idea was nice. Create a space where everyone feels comfortable. It’s kinda like finding the right spot to fish.
Walter: Like here. Calm waters, good shade, nice temperature. 
Walter: We can just sit and wait for the fish to join us on their own time.
pause(3)
Walter: Hmm, nothing yet?
Walter: Let’s keep at it. Persistence pays off.

Walter: Yep, that’s one big trout. Nice work. I’m sure it’ll make a fine addition to the chowder.
Walter: Hmm...
Walter: Listen, Scout, you should head back down on your own. I’m sure you still got lots of ingredients to prepare.
Walter: I think I’ll stay here a while. It’s a perfect day for fishing...
