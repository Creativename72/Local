inScene: Scout, Walter


id:start
:[The weather is clear, and the morning sun casts a warm glow over the valley as Scout hikes up to the tower, taking in the fresh, crisp air.]
:[They reach the tower and ascend the steps up to the balcony. Through the glass windows, Scout spots Walter sketching at his desk.]


[choice1]
[Ring the doorbell.]
[choice2]
[Yell for his attention.]
[choice3]
[Run to the other side of the balcony and wave at him through the window.]


id:choice1
:[Scout reaches up to the side of the door to ring the bell before realizing there is no doorbell at all.]
:[Instead, they knock on the side of the wooden door, getting Walter’s attention.]
:[Walter hears and turns his head, getting up from his seat and walking over to the door, opening it.]

Walter: Scout, glad to see you. Come on in.
goto:inside


id:choice2
:[Scout yells through the windows at Walter, who immediately turns around with an alarmed expression.]
:[He gets up from the desk and goes to open the door, scratching the side of his head.]

Walter: Gosh, Scout, you startled me. You know better’n to go yellin’ ‘nless there’s an emergency.
Walter: Come on in.
goto:inside


id:choice3
:[Scout makes their way around the balcony to the window in front of Walter and waits patiently until they catch his attention.]
:[Walter looks up from his desk with an amused expression, the kind of look Scout now recognizes as Walter’s “trying not to smile” face.]

Walter: Scout? Forget where the front door is? 
Walter: Come on in.
goto:inside


id:inside
:[Scout enters Walter’s living space. The air here is much warmer than the air outside, and Scout takes a moment to collect their bearings.]

Walter: What brings you back here so soon?


[organizing]
I’m organizing a get-together dinner with everyone in the valley.

id:organizing
[gonna_cook]
I was gonna cook a big meal and wanted to invite you.

id:after_invite
:[Walter pauses, his expression tightening slightly.] 

Walter: And by everyone, you mean Annie and Tyler, too?
Walter: Look, Scout, I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but… things have been a bit rough between us lately. I’m not sure a dinner is going to fix that.


:[What do you want to say?]
[a_start]
It won’t solve everything, but it’ll be a start…
[you_care]
You all mean a lot to each other, even if things are rough…
[move_forward]
I know it’s hard, but you can’t keep holding onto the past…


id:a_start
[a_start2]
Getting everyone together would be a good first step.

id:a_start2
:[Walter sighs and looks out the window for a moment before turning back to Scout.] 
Walter: I suppose you’re right. It won’t solve everything, but it’s a start.
:[He looks away for a moment.] 
Walter: It’s been such a long time since we all sat down with each other and talked.
Walter: Maybe getting everyone together is what we need to break the ice.
goto:continue


id:you_care
[you_care2]
I’ve been around the valley. I know how much each of you care.

id:you_care2
:[Walter’s expression softens as he listens.] 
Walter: You’ve been paying attention, haven’t you? Running all over the valley, talking to everyone here. 
:[He chuckles.]
Walter: I guess we all still care. It’s just hard to remember that sometimes. It’s been so long…
Walter: Alright, you’ve convinced me. Maybe this dinner is what we need to start mending our relationship.
goto:continue


id:move_forward
[move_forward2]
We need to move forward and face the situation head on.

id:move_forward2
:[Walter looks down, his jaw tightening slightly.] 
Walter: Easier said than done, Scout. But…
:[He sighs, running a hand through his fur.] 
Walter: You’ve got a point. Holding onto the past isn’t doing us any favors.
Walter: Alright. Let’s do this.
goto:continue


id:continue
Walter: Okay, let’s figure this out. You said this was a dinner? What are we bringing to the table?


[chowder]
Some sorta Fish Chowder.

id:chowder
:[Walter’s expression softens a bit.] 
Walter: Fish Chowder, hmm? Always did have a soft spot for that dish.
Walter: That was one of the more popular dishes I used to prep back at the cafeteria I worked at.
:[Walter appears lost in thought.] 
Walter: All those quiet mornings alone in that kitchen, chopping vegetables, deboning fish…
:[He snaps out of it.] 
Walter: Ah, well, what fish were you thinking of including?


[planning_on_you]
Not sure. I was planning on asking you.


id:planning_on_you
:[Walter smiles.] 
Walter: Well, I have always had a fondness for trout. The sweet undertone, with a hint of nuttiness…
Walter: There’s plenty of trout to catch in the lakes just up the trail from here. They’re easy to spot with their gold scales and red stripes. 


[sounds_good]
Sounds good! Let’s head out.

[see_red]
I can’t see red!


id:sounds_good
goto:trail


id:see_red
:[Walter chuckles.] 
Walter: No need to worry. I still got a good set of eyes. Plus, they’re pretty distinctive even without the stripes.
Walter: Shall we head off?
goto:trail


id:trail
:[Walter grabs his fishing gear, and the two of them set off on the trail towards the lake.]

:[Walter and Scout move their way up the trail to the mountain-top lake. As the hike goes on, Walter begins to speak.]


Walter: This trail used to be a lot busier.
Walter: Families, hikers, campers… It's been quieter these past few years.
pause(3)
Walter: Sometimes I miss it. People out in nature, enjoying the scenery, and each other’s company.
pause(3)
Walter: Always thought places like this were one of the best places for people to connect with each other…
pause(3)
Walter: You’re doing a good thing, Scout. Bringing everyone together, reminding us what we’ve got here. I think we all lost sight of that.
Walter: So, thank you.
pause(3)
Walter: Ah, uh, the lake should be just up here…
Walter: Here, take this rod, and let’s see what we can fish up.
