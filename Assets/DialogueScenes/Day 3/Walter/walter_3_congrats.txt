Walter: Great job, Scout!


:[Walter holds up the line with his hand.]


Walter: Yep, that’s one big trout. Nice work. I’m sure it’ll make a fine addition to the chowder.
Walter: Hmm…
Walter: Listen, Scout, you should head back down on your own. I’m sure you still got lots of ingredients to prepare.
Walter: I think I’ll stay here a while. It’s a perfect day for fishing…




Scout: Alright. Thanks for spending the afternoon with me, Walter.




Scout: And for helping me get the fish.




Walter: I’ll see you tonight, then.

:[Scout packs up their gear and the fish they just caught and starts down the trail. Behind them, the sun casts a warm glow over the whole of the valley.]
