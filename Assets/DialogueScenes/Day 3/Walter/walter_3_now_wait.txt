Walter: And now, we wait.

Walter: You know, fishing is a lot like making friends. You need patience, a bit of luck, a willingness to keep trying, even when things don’t seem to be biting.


pause([3])


Walter: Sometimes, you spend hours out here without a single nibble, and just when you’re about to give up, something tugs on your line.


pause([3])


Walter: You need to keep checking your bait and casting your line. You have to let the fish come to you just like letting someone open up to you when they're ready. It takes time.

Walter: Your dinner idea was nice. Create a space where everyone feels comfortable. It’s kinda like finding the right spot to fish.
Walter: Like here. Calm waters, good shade, nice temperature. 
Walter: We can just sit and wait for the fish to join us on their own time.

Walter: Hmm, nothing yet?
Walter: Let’s keep at it. Persistence pays off.
