Looks a lot better now.

Tyler:Yeah, I guess it does. Thanks for the help.
Tyler:And ah, I guess you can see how many hobbies I’ve dropped over the years, ha.
Tyler:I...
:[Tyler hesitates for a moment. He glances at Scout.]
Tyler:Lemme show you.
:[Scout is taken around the back of the trailer and water reservoir to a large, well-tended vegetable garden. The plants are neatly arranged, and it’s clear that Tyler put a lot of work into this place.]
Tyler:This right here. My garden.
[impressive]
Impressive!
[did_all_this]
You did all this?
[cool]
Oh, cool.

Tyler:[Tyler touches the side of the water reservoir.] It’s been getting harder to water my plants since my water tank exploded.
Tyler:Or... it’s a long story. Was settin’ up my water pump, and Walter was there, and Annie was there...
Tyler:Then Walter left, and I turned on the pump, and my truck caught fire, and Annie drove my truck into the reservoir.
Tyler:[His brow furrows.] Then Walter came back and yelled at me, and then he yelled at Annie.
Tyler:And we haven't talked since. Ugh.
Tyler:Whatever. My water thing’s busted. That’s the takeaway.
:[Tyler pauses for a moment. He looks at his garden, then back at Scout.]
Tyler:Scout... Thanks again for helpin’ me clean up. ‘N listenin’ to me yap ‘bout all this stuff.
Tyler:It’s a lot nicer doin’ this chore with someone else. So if you wanna come back sometime and clean the inside of my trailer too...
Tyler:[Tyler chuckles.] Kiddin’. Maybe. Consider it.
Tyler:I... come back if you need anythin’ from me, ‘kay? It’s been fun just, talkin’, too.
Tyler:I gotta haul all the stuff we tossed back to the city before the recycling depot closes. 
Tyler:I’ll see you ‘round soon, yeah?
:[With that, Tyler drags some things into his truck bed and drives onto the main road, back towards the city.]
:[After a moment, Scout heads back down the dirt path, disappearing among the trees as they make their way back to their own corner of the valley.]
