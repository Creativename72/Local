Nice grill. Do you still use it?

:[Tyler glances at the grill, then back at Scout, shrugging.]
Tyler:Nah, haven’t used him much. Used to love grillin’ fish, but I ain’t much of a fishman.
Tyler:Tried grillin’ veggies, but man, it ain’t the same.
[where_get]
So where’d you get the fish?

id:where_get
Tyler:Psh. Walter.
Tyler:[Tyler's expression hardens a bit.] Look, Walter’s good at what he does ‘n all, but I don’t need his help. I can figure it out on my own.
[what_eating]
What are you eating nowadays?

id:what_eating
Tyler:Simple stuff.  Canned, frozen foods, whatever I can get at the general store a few miles up the road.
Tyler:And the veggies I’m growin’, if I’m feeling like it.
Tyler:Whatever. Maybe I should just get rid of this thing.
[keep]
Keep it. You might use it in the future.
[toss]
Yeah, toss.

id:keep
Tyler:...yeah. Maybe you’re right.
Tyler:He’s a good grill. We did have some great times.
:[Tyler drags the grill to a spot near his gardens.]

Tyler:Mmhm. Ain’t no point in keepin’ him around if I ain’t usin’ him.
