inscene: Tyler

:[The sky is overcast, with a light drizzle of rain falling over the valley.]
:[Scout moves along the muddy trail leading up to Tyler’s trailer encampment.]
:[As Scout approaches, Tyler is leaning against the side of his trailer in the rain. His outfit is much bolder than the PJs he wore yesterday.]
:[He waits for Scout to approach before speaking.]
Tyler:Hey.
Tyler:Whaddya think? [He gestures to his outfit.]
[dig_it]
Of your jacket? I dig it.
[what_in_world]
What in the world are you wearing.

Tyler:[Tyler grins.] Heck yeah.
Tyler:You caught me yesterday in my PJs. Just thought it’d be fair to show you what I’m normally like.

Tyler:[Tyler scoffs.] It’s called style, sweetie. Guess I shouldn’t expect you to get it.
Tyler:You caught me yesterday in my PJs. Just thought it’d be fair to show you what I’m normally rockin’.

[sleep]
You should sleep in that outfit so you won’t be caught in PJs anymore.
[rain]
How long have you been standing in the rain like that?

[sleep]
Tyler:Oh, so when Scouts drop by by surprise just when I roll outta bed, I at least don’t look like I’m late to a slumber party?
Tyler:[He chuckles.] Good idea.
goto:play

[rain]
Tyler:Ah, I dunno. [He checks his wrist, which doesn’t have a watch on it.]
Tyler:Like, at least ‘n hour or two. We didn’t decide on a meetin’ time yesterday...
Tyler:[He shrugs.] It’s whatever. I like the rain. Now I look all mysterious ‘n brooding. Grr.

:[Tyler disappears inside the trailer.]
:[Moments later, the sounds of rummaging and clatter drift out the door.]
:[Tyler emerges with an electric guitar slung over his shoulders. He yanks the power cord and a set of speakers come tumbling down the trailer steps into the mud.]
Tyler:Look what I just picked up!
Tyler:Cool stuff, yeah? [He searches his pocket for a pick to play with.]
[very_cool]
Yes. Very cool.
[alright]
It’s alright, I guess.

:[Tyler smirks and strikes a power chord. Instead of a blast of music, a feeble crackle emits from the speakers. Tyler’s expression falters.]
Tyler:Ah, crap.
:[He unplugs and re-plugs the cables, trying again with no better results. He kicks the speakers, then sighs, looking dejected.]
Tyler:Man...
Tyler:Stuff’s always breakin’ round here. I don’t get it.
:[Tyler pushes the speaker set aside with his foot, then sets his guitar down on the steps of the trailer.]
Tyler:Y’know, I got all this junk lyin’ around from hobbies I never stuck with. Guess I thought each one was gonna be my [thing], but... yeah.
[clean]
Maybe it’s time to clean things up.

You sure have a lot of hobbies, then.

Tyler:Anyways, yeah, I think I should get around to cleanin’ things up. Mind lending a hand?
