[nice]
Nice looking bike.

Tyler:Oh yeah. Was obsessed with bikers when I was a kid. Thought they were so badass.
Tyler:Used to ride this baby everywhere in the city.
Tyler:Now, uh, not so much.
[happened]
What happened?

Tyler:[He scratches his head.] Took her out for a spin on some trails near the river, but wiped out pretty bad. Turns out “all-terrain” doesn’t really mean that.
Tyler:I think the.. axle.. is busted? That's a part of a bike, right?
Tyler:Yeah, I dunno. It’ll be a project to fix her back to working condition. And I don’t know bike stuff.
Tyler:Walter does, but... ugh... We’re not talkin’, I guess.
Tyler:Whatever. Do I keep this thing?
[keep]
Keep it. You can fix it in the future.
[toss]
Toss it. It’s junk.

id:keep
Tyler:I guess. 
Tyler:I’ll just shove it somewhere dry for now.

Tyler:Yeah, I think I’m all ridden out. It’s just takin’ up space now.
