What about that license plate?

id:what
Annie: Oh that? That’s from my drag racing days, believe it or not.
[cars]
You raced cars?

id:cars
Annie:Oh yeah, hard to picture now, right? Back in the day, I lived for the thrill of the track.
Annie:That surge of adrenaline as I revved up the engines, feeling the power of the car beneath me…
Annie:God, what a rush that was.
Annie:Had to stop when my vision started to deteriorate. That sucked.
Annie:Buuuut… maybe it was for the better.
Annie:If I could still drive cars while blind, I’d probably do it. But it’s illegal. Lame.
Annie:Kidding! But really, I couldn’t have spent my whole life racing cars. Needed to settle for something, I guess.
[miss]
Do you miss racing?

id:miss
Annie: Every now and then, yeah. But that was years and years ago.
Annie: Life’s about adapting, and now I’m just rollin’ with the punches.
