Annie:Hey there, Scout. I, like, just woke up.
Annie:Sorry if I seem a little out of it, had one of those marathon calls last night. 
Annie:Guy on the other end just would not stop yapping. I stayed on for like an hour past my shift end time.
[Hang Up]
Couldn't you just hang up?
[Rough]
Sounds rough.

id:Hang Up
Annie:Mmm nah. Company policy. We gotta stay on call for like half an hour after shifts end.
Annie:I don’t like to leave incomplete calls anyway, like people’re calling cause they need help, and I don’t wanna leave anyone stranded, you know?

Annie: Tell me about it. Fridays are always a drag with those late shifts. Makes me feel like a zombie on weekends.
goto:lake

id:lake
Annie: Was all set for goin' down to the lake today, too. But my energy levels are like, real low. 
Annie: Plus, it's like raining, so I dunno how good of a time we'd have by the water anyway.
Annie: I might take a midday nap. You alright with just staying in for a bit before then?
[fine]
Fine by me!

Annie: Here, come on in, make yourself at home.
:[Annie leads Scout into the cabin.]
:[The interior exudes warmth and charm. The walls are covered in photos of Annie and others, paintings and knick-knacks.]

Your place is so cozy!
[cozy]
Love your decorations.

Annie: Hey, thanks!
Annie: You know, ever since I lost part of my vision I never really got back into decorating. 
Annie: Like, the only person who would see it would be my sister when she visits.

You lost your vision?
[residents]
What about the other valley residents? Do they visit?

"..."

id:vision
Annie: Yeah. I had normal vision til' a few years ago.
Annie: I lost it over time. Was pretty rough. Had to make some major changes to my life and career.
Annie: [Annie looks up at Scout.] My sis helped a lot, though. She was always there.
Annie: She drives me up to the city on occasion for weekend trips.

Annie: What, you mean Bernice, Walter and Tyler?
Annie: I mean, I have Bernice over for tea sometimes, but like, I don't like her climbing all the way up here each time she visits.
Annie: She's getting pretty old, don't think the trails're for her anymore.
Annie: Walter and Tyler...
Annie: We used to hang out a lot together. Like, here at my cabin or by the lake. 
Annie: Well, there was a bit of a situation with us three a whiles ago.
Annie: Really haven't spoken to them since. I dunno. It kinda soured our relationship.

Annie: Aaanyways, I sometimes forget what I even have up on these walls.
Annie: Like I gotta press my face right up to the photos and stuff to even make out the details.
[point]
I could point stuff out!

Annie: [Annie chuckles] Thats so sweet! Yeah, let's do it.
