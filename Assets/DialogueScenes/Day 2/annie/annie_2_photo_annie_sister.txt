Annie:Oh my goodness, that’s from the road trip Maggie and I took a few years back!
Annie:Maggie’s my sister, by the way.
Annie:We wanted to visit all the diners in the state or somethin’, like a diner-hopping road trip? She loves diner food.
Annie:She printed out a map of the state and planned out a route and everything.
Annie:We only ended up going to like six places though.

Trip ended early?

Annie:I dunno, man. Like, you can only have so much pancakes, burgers, and apple pie before the thought of it makes you want to throw up.
Annie:But it was nice. It was a nice trip. I had fun. Saw a bunch of dumb roadside attractions.
Annie:And I got to hang with my sis. That was the best part.
