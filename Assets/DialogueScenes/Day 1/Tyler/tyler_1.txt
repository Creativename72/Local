inScene: Scout, Tyler


id:start
:[A dirt path leads up to the trailer, branching off from the main road and winding through the trees.]
:[A beat-up looking trailer sits nestled among the foliage. The trailer bears the marks of its travels, with faded paint and a slightly crooked door. Junk is scattered all around the site.]


[knock]
Knock on the door.


id:knock
:[Something stirs from within the trailer. The sound of something being knocked over. A curse word.]
:[Whoever’s on the other side quickly scrambles to the door, opening it just a crack. It’s hard to make out who’s inside.]


???: …who’re you supposed ‘ta be?


[im_scout]
I’m Scout.


id:im_scout
???: [He grumbles.] What, like a junior scout or somethin’? You try’na sell me cookies?


[my_name]
No… Scout is my name. I just moved into the valley.
[cookies]
Yep! Got twin mint and shortstacks, take your pick.


id:cookies
:[The pair of eyes looks at Scout, and at the space behind them.]


???: I don’t see no cookie wagon behind you…
???: You try’na pull a fast one on me?


[kidding]
Kidding. I just moved into the valley.


id:kidding
???: [The voice chuckles.] Yeah, sounds ‘bout right.

:[There’s a brief silence as the eyes look Scout up and down.]
:[Suddenly, the door closes, as the person fiddles with the chain lock. Soon after, it swings fully open.]

:[On the other side stands a badger, still in his pajamas. He rubs his eyes and does a great big stretch.]


Badger: Well, Scout you picked a heckuva time to show up uninvited. [He yawns.] What do you want?


[just_moved_in]
Just trying to make some friends around the valley.


id:just_moved_in
Badger: Yippee.
Badger:...
Badger: I’m Tyler. Just so ya know.


[nice_to_meet]
Nice to meet you, Tyler.


id:nice_to_meet
Tyler: Yeah, you too.


[you_live_like_this]
You live in a trailer?
[stuff]
You sure have a lotta stuff everywhere here.


id:you_live_like_this
Tyler: [Tyler cracks a smile.] You bet I do. It's my ticket to freedom, my mobile fortress.
Tyler: I mean, it don’t drive no more, but it’s my home sweet home.

id:stuff
Tyler: Yeah, and it’s MY stuff, so no scrounging.
Tyler: [He chuckles.] I’m keepin’ my eye on you.
goto:show_round


id:show_round
Tyler: Hey, why don’t I show ya ‘round?


:[Tyler climbs down the front steps of the trailer, gesturing for Scout to follow him.]


Tyler: [He puts his hands on his hips, proudly.] Well, this here’s the front yard. Prime real estate for, uh, anythin’ I’m workin’ on.
Tyler: Most people got a livin’ room, I got this beautiful piece o’ land here.
Tyler: …It’s a work in progress.


:[He walks up to a dented water reservoir, patting the side.]


Tyler: Here’s where I keep my water. For showers ‘n stuff. 
Tyler: Haven’t really been able ‘ta get the pump workin’. And it's always leakin’... 


:[Tyler walks over to the beat up red truck parked a little ways away.]


Tyler: Here’s my truck.
Tyler: I drive her to the city when I need. Yeah.
Tyler: Any questions?


[missing_hood]
Is the hood supposed to be missing?
[what_do_you_do]
What do you do for a living?
[clean_up]
Ever thought about cleaning up?


id:missing_hood
Tyler: Yeah, well, I needed the scrap metal to patch up the water reservoir. 
Tyler: Plus, it adds character, don’t ya think?
goto:rawr


id:what_do_you_do
Tyler: I meant questions ‘bout my space, man.
Tyler: But, I’m more of a free spirit, ya know? Moved here to get away from the confines of society.
Tyler: I’m just out here doing my own thing. ‘S not that complicated. 
goto:rawr


id:clean_up
Tyler: [He raises an eyebrow.] What‘chu try’na say ‘bout my home, huh?
Tyler: I know this ain’t exactly a five-star hotel, but it’s how I like it.
goto:rawr


id:rawr
Tyler: Yeeeep, it’s mostly just me out here. I’m a bit of a lone wolf. Rawr.


[others]
What about the others who live in the valley?


id:others
Tyler: Guh, what.
Tyler: I mean, yeah, I know ‘em. 
Tyler: Annie’s like, a bit north of me, up the hill, I dunno…
Tyler: She’s been busy or somethin’...
Tyler: And Walter’s in his fancy tower at the other side of the valley.
Tyler: And hes… ack…
Tyler: Well, I don’t hang out with those two anymore. And that’s all I have ‘ta say ‘bout that right now.


:[Tyler checks his wrist, which doesn’t have a watch on it.]


Tyler: Phew, wow, it’s like, what, 2 o’ clock already? I gotta go get me some breakfast.
Tyler: But hey, this was cool. You should swing by again sometime. Maybe, definitely tomorrow.
Tyler: I’ll be wearin’ somethin’ more… presentable, alrighty? Cool.


:[Tyler hops back up the stairs of his trailer, giving Scout a wink before slamming the door to his trailer.]

:[After that encounter, Scout walks back along the dirt path onto the main road once again.]
